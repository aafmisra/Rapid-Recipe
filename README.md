# Rapid-Recipe :stew: :curry: :spaghetti:


## About This App

! [ ]( )

I love to cook. My father is from India, and thanks to him I have tried and learned how to cook many different cuisines. My partner, on the other hand, knows how to cook about 5 things and most of them involve pasta. Rapid Recipe is for both of us. 

Even though I love cooking, I often find myself making the same dishes over and over, either out of convenience or because it's just too much work to go looking for new recipes on the internet. It's hard to do when you don't know what you want to eat. I made Rapid Recipe because it was something I really wanted to exist. Now, when my partner and I meal plan, we can use Rapid Recipe to find new dishes using ingredients we already have.

## Planning

### User stories

#### Who will use Rapid Recipe?

Everyone eats, so Rapid Recipe should be usable for as many people as possible.

#### Why will they use it?

Anyone who already loves cooking and wants to add variety. Anyone who is learning to cook and wants to try new things. Budget conscious people who want to make delicious things using what they already have. Anyone with an allergy or diet restriction who needs safe recipes.

#### What is Rapid Recipe?

It is an app that allows users to input ingredients to search for recipes in Edamam's database. 

### Notes and wireframes

This wireframe shows my vision for a landing page with a simple design, with search form and results gallery components.
